  "description": "The Value Set is a combination of two sets of codes:  X12 Claim Adjustment Reason Codes (CARC) and CMS Remittance Advice Remark Codes (RARC).  CARC codes describe why a claim or service line was paid differently than it was billed.  RARC codes provide additional explanation for an adjustment already described by a Claim Adjustment Reason Code (CARC) or convey information about remittance processing.  \nUse of X12 CARC codes require a license.  Reference https://x12.org/codes/.  RARC codes are available at http://www.wpc-edi.com/reference/codelists/healthcare/remittance-advice-remark-codes.",
