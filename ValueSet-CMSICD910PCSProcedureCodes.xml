  <description value="The Value Set is a combination of values from volume 3 from the Code System International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) and values in the Code System ICD-10 Procedure Coding System. The International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) is based on the World Health Organization&#x2019;s Ninth Revision, International Classification of Diseases (ICD-9). ICD-9-CM was the official system of assigning codes to diagnoses and procedures associated with hospital utilization in the United States.  The ICD-9-CM consists of: a tabular list containing a numerical list of the disease code numbers in tabular form; an alphabetical index to the disease entries; and a classification system for surgical, diagnostic, and therapeutic procedures (alphabetic index and tabular list). The National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services are the U.S. governmental agencies responsible for overseeing all changes and modifications to the ICD-9-CM. ICD-10 Procedure Coding System is the replacement for ICD-9-CM, volume 3, effective October 1, 2015. Current and previous releases of ICD-9-CM are available here: https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/icd/icd9cm.htm Most files are provided in compressed zip format for ease in downloading. These files have been created by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), under authorization by the World Health Organization. Any questions regarding typographical or other errors noted on this release may be reported to nchsicd10cm@cdc.gov. The ICD-10-PCS is a procedure classification published by the United States Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) (https://www.cms.gov) for classifying procedures performed in hospital inpatient health care settings. Link to information about the code system: https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Coding/ICD10 Note: CMS is the owner of the ICD-10-PCS code system. CMS is NOT the owner of ICD-10-CM. CMS republishes the ICD-10-CM codes system on their website for convienence only. For authoratative information on ICD-10-CM, users should refer to the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) site located here."/>
