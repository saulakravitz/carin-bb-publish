Modifiers help further describe a procedure code without changing its definition.  \nCPT codes are available by subscription from the AMA at http://www.ama-assn.org/go/cpt.  HCPCS codes are available at http://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Coding/HCPCSReleaseCodeSets.  The link takes one to a list of files.  The target set for this Code System is the procedure code modifiers from this file.  \n\n**MODIFIER CODES ONLY**",
