  "description": "The Value Set is a combination of two sets of codes: X12 Claim Adjustment Reason Codes (CARC) and CMS Remittance Advice Remark Codes (RARC). \nCARC codes describe why a claim or service line was paid differently than it was billed. RARC codes provide additional explanation for an adjustment already described by a \nClaim Adjustment Reason Code (CARC) or convey information about remittance processing. CARC codes are owned, maintained and distributed by X12. \nRARC codes are available at http://www.wpc-edi.com/reference/codelists/healthcare/remittance-advice-remark-codes.",
